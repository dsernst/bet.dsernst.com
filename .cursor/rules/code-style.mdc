# Cursor Style Guide

## Data Structure Patterns

High level rule: "Prefer simple and clean, over complex".

- Prefer simple arrays of primitive values over arrays of objects when possible
- Use numbers instead of strings when the data is numeric, even if it will be displayed as a string
- Avoid storing display formatting (like '%') in the data layer

## React/JSX Patterns
- Remove unused attributes (like `id` when not needed for functionality)
- Keep data transformation close to where it's used (like appending '%' in the JSX)
- Use inline arrays for small, static data sets instead of declaring variables
- Use array indices for generating keys when the data is static and order won't change

## Code Organization
- Minimize intermediate variables when they don't add clarity
