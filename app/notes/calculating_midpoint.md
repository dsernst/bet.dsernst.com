# ARITHMETIC MIDPOINT

INPUTS: 2 people's personal best guess Probabilities
99% | 50%

simple mid: 74.5%

YES @ $.745 per $1
(believe 99%â€” willing to pay .99)

.745 cost
.99 value

.99 - .745 = .245 absolute discount

# .245 / .99 = 24.7% relative discount

NO @ $.255 per $1
(believe 50%â€” willing to pay .50)
.255 cost
.50 value

.5 - .255 = .245 absolute discount

# .245 / .5 = 49% relative discount

absolute discounts are equal
relative discounts are not equal

# RELATIVE MIDPOINT

INPUTS: 2 people's personal best guess Probabilities
99% | 50%
a | b

relative mid: x

YES @ x per $1
(believe 99%â€” willing to pay .99)

x cost
.99 value

.99 - x = y absolute discount
y / .99 = z relative discount

NO @ (1-x) per $1
(believe 50%â€” willing to pay .50)
(1-x) cost
.50 value

.5 - (1-x) = u absolute discount
u / .5 = v relative discount

Goal: Find x, such that `z == v`
z = v
y / .99 = u / .5

(.99 - x) / .99 = (.5 - (1-x)) / .5

(a - x) / a = (b - (1-x)) / b
(a - x) = a _ (b - (1-x)) / b
b _ (a - x) = a \* (b - (1-x))

ba - bx = ab - a + ax
ba = ab - a + ax + bx
ab - ab + a = ax + bx
a = ax + bx
a = (a + b)x
a/(a+b) = x

## x = a/(a+b)

a=.99
b=.5
x = .99/(.99+.5)
x = .99/(1.49)
x = 0.6644

relative mid: 66.44%

YES @ $.6644 per $1
(believe 99%â€” willing to pay .99)

.6644 cost

.99 - .664 = .326 absolute discount

# .326 / .99 = 32.9% relative discount

.5 - .336 = .164 absolute discount

# .164 / .5 = 32.8% relative discount
